# Barren Fungus

Barren Fungus has lost all acquaintance with himself. He used to consider himself a dynamic person. With season, circumstances, wealth, job... and even food changing, he kept changing and finally become someone else, totally. This, can be one of the most mysterious problems he has ever met in his life. That makes him unique in the river flow of the time.

Barren' memories are always totally and seemingly missing. Somehow, what he thought to be real can only be real in the reality he could never reach, where he could find some satisfying reality while other parts of it unsustainably remain. This won't be a pity if never be told, though.

The darkness of cloud with the rest of sunshine lit up mountains in a weird way. Barren fell in love with the scene, where sadness and hope seemed to be equal, equal and equal, just like being half burning in a winter biting cold.

Cold air, green trees, dark sky. Wonderful. Thousands of slim segments were infiltrating Barren's skin. Something primitive, inevitable and... familiar filled him up.

Only the river flows, the wind blows. The sky is eternal, the mountains are perpetual.

Barren could see things inside, clearly.

The river. It's just, water, right?

The river never stops. He couldn't tell if some sound came from his beating heart, hollow mind or just the god hidding in the sky, where the sun was still shining. The fresh and sweet scent of tea leaves came just like comfort which was either futile or perfunctory during one's depression, or just the Thorns of Goodwill that comes to stab you unintentionally only when you are deperately not in desperated need of them.

The sunshine came after the rain was just wonderful. Blue gray mixed with gold.

> I can't 'normally' stand the change, just like I can't stand changing the change to be changed by someone else."

Truth be told, no one can understand his disappointment, at least for now. Ridiculousness was always on a par with *tommyrot*. How could Barren stick to his bottom line while fix it to some point so as to be invulnerable when under attack on such trivia and nothing?
